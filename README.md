I just want someone to burn with me. To bleed with me. Someone who wants me unconditionally, fully, in all my worthlessness and pain and shame and longing. Who understands me and accepts me for it. This message is a cry for help. A desperate longing for someone with this same kind of emotionality to stumble across this profile and feel the same way. A longing for someone to love me and feel me the same way, mutually, to this level of depth and shared reciprocity, kindredness and warmth. Maybe that person is reading this right now. Maybe that day will never come. I will never stop looking for that level of intimacy, for that level of authenticity and unconditional love that makes me feel whole again, to complete me. I will never stop looking for that person. And I will crash and burn as many times as it takes.
